**Pizza Sales SQL Project**

**Introduction**
This project marks my first foray into the world of SQL and data analysis. Utilizing a pizza sales dataset, I aimed to extract meaningful insights and practice my SQL skills. The dataset comprises various tables, including orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. Throughout this project, I executed queries ranging from basic to intermediate levels using MySQL.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset used in this project consists of four primary tables:
**orders:** 
Contains details of each order placed, including the order ID, date, and customer information.
**order_details:** 
Includes specific information about each item in an order, such as order ID, pizza ID, quantity, and price.
**pizzas:** 
Lists all the pizzas available, with details such as pizza ID, name, and size.
**pizza_types:** 
Provides descriptions of different types of pizzas, including ingredients and category.

**Project Objectives**
The primary objectives of this project were to:

- Gain hands-on experience with SQL and MySQL tools.
- Understand the structure and relationships within the pizza sales dataset.
- Execute various queries to analyze sales data and extract useful insights.

**Queries Executed**

**Basic:**
1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.
2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.
3. Identify the highest-priced pizza.
4. Identify the most common pizza size ordered.
5. List the top 5 most ordered pizza types along with their quantities.


**Intermediate:**
1. Join the necessary tables to find the total quantity of each pizza category ordered.
2. Determine the distribution of orders by hour of the day.
3. Join relevant tables to find the category-wise distribution of pizzas.
4. Group the orders by date and calculate the average number of pizzas ordered per day.
5. Determine the top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue.

**Learning Outcomes**
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Use MySQL to manage and query databases.
- Write SQL queries to retrieve and analyze data.
- Understand and manipulate relational database structures.
- Derive insights from data to inform business decisions.

**Conclusion**
This project provided a solid foundation in SQL and data analysis. By working with a real-world dataset, I enhanced my understanding of database management and developed skills that will be invaluable in future data analytics endeavors.
